# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why did you start this project?

We explain our rationale for our project on our [about page](/docs/about).

## Why don't you support my favorite client or feature?

Chances are, we would like to support it, but it has not been implemented yet. MediaVault is a an entirely volunteer-driven project, so until a developer is able and willing to implement a feature, it likely will not be done. We track community feature requests [here](https://github.com/media-vault/mediavault/issues), so please check that out, interact in discussions with features you like, and add your own requests. Note that this does not guarantee prioritization, but instead provides developers a way of seeing what features might be popular to decide whether to work on them or not. This does unfortunately mean that even highly-soughtafter features might not be implemented until someone both interested and able to work on them comes along. If you are a developer and are interested in helping out, [please dev away](/docs/contributing) and let us know [on Discord](/contact) so we can help!

## When will release \{X} happen? When will feature \{X} be available?

We make releases only when the team feels that it is ready, to provide our users with the best and most stable experience we can.
To that end, releases happen when we feel there has been sufficient testing without new issues being found.
Releases are also subject to the availability of the people who manage the builds and publishes for different platforms.
Please remember we are all volunteers and there are no fixed timelines to our releases.

## I'm having problems with MediaVault, how do I get help?

Please see out [getting help](/docs/getting-help) page for details on where to engage the community.

## Why is my media not showing up in MediaVault?

This normally comes down to one of the following issues:

1. [File permissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File-system_permissions) are not properly configured on your media.
2. Your media does not follow the organizational requirements for MediaVault's scanner to properly identify media. (Valid organization schemes can be found in the documentation for Movies, Shows, Music, and others). If it's not one of these, please consider asking for help as it might be a bug.

## How can I contribute to this project?

Please see our [contributing guide](/docs/contributing) page for details on how to get started. We are always looking for Java and frontend developers, mobile app developers, translators, and documentation writers to help!

## How do I request a new feature?

Please see our [requesting features](/docs/contributing/issues#requesting-features) page for details in requesting a new feature in MediaVault.

## How do I support this project?

All we can ask is for you to [use MediaVault](/docs/installation), [report any bugs found](/docs/contributing/issues#reporting-bugs), and tell your friends and family about us! Really, we are just people volunteering our time to help build a better media system, so joining the community is the best way to show your support. We do offer a donations page [on OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com), however please note that these funds are only used for infrastructure. All our developers are unpaid volunteers on principle.
