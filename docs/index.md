# Welcome to the LibreUno Documentation

LibreUno is a free open-source media streaming system that puts you in control of managing and streaming your media and video games. It is an alternative to the proprietary Emby and Plex, to provide media from a dedicated server to end-user devices via multiple apps. LibreUno is written in its own codebase in Java. There are no strings attached, no premium features or licenses, and no hidden agendas: just a team who wants to build something better and work together to achieve it. We welcome anyone who is intersted in joining our quest.

You can find a list of all available clients [here](/). For more information see our [about page](/docs/about) or the [FAQ](/docs/faq). If you are looking for help, check out [this page](/docs/getting-help) for all the different communication channels we use.

Note: LibreUno is fast-moving project that is in its early stages, and this documentation as well as the code may change frequently. Please check back often and do not hesitate to contact us via out channels or forum!
