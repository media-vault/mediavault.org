# About MediaVault

MediaVault is an open-source Software Media System that puts you in control of managing and streaming your media and video games. It is an alternative to the proprietary Emby and Plex and the open-source Jellyfin, to provide media from a dedicated server to end-user devices via multiple apps. MediaVault is written in its own Java codebase to enable full cross-platform support. There are no strings attached, no premium licenses or features, and no hidden agendas; just a team who want to build something better and work together to achieve it. We welcome anyone who is interested in joining us in our quest!

MediaVault seeks to continue development with a Free Software ethos. it is committed to brining all its users access to the best possible Media System, developed entirely by a community of volunteers who contribute code, documentation, translations, and support to the project.
